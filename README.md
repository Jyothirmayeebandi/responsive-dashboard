This project was developed as part of working with VeriSync Labs, showcasing skills in creating responsive and user-friendly dashboards for enhanced user data interaction. The dashboard is designed to adapt seamlessly across desktop and mobile views, providing key functionalities such as search, sorting, and detailed user data display.


# Project Features:

* Responsive Design: Ensures a smooth user experience across devices with grid layouts on desktop and single-column views on mobile.
* Data Fetching and Display: User data is fetched from a mock API and presented in an intuitive card-based layout.
* Search and Sort Functionalities: Allows for easy filtering by name or username and sorting options for efficient data navigation.
* User Details Modal: Includes a hover-triggered "View Details" button on each user card, leading to a modal with comprehensive user information (address, phone, website).
* Clean UI: Emphasizes a visually appealing and functional design, with a focus on user engagement and data accessibility.
